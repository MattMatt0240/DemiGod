This game will take place in ~ midevil era + mild fantasy included. There will be no "filters"
for profanity, gore, or humor (Mature Audience).

 The hero will roam the "world" as in game's like Final Fantasy, or pokemon, with a similar battle
 system. The battles will occur randomly while roaming "dangerous" areas in the world.
 
 I need help in the following aspects:

 * Maps (world, towns, buildings) I need to know if my method of "tiling" is efficient/effective
 		
 		++ I am now considering/testing JSON for map properties
 
 * User interaction with NPC/AI characters (Dialog, recieving quests, etc...)
 
 * Shops/inventory: Exchanging of items between shop (Item Database) and hero (Inventory Database).
   
    + equipping items, such as armor or weapons from inventory
   
    + "Inventory slots"
   
 * The actual Turn-Based mechanics. (AI decision-making)
 
 * Player's party (up to 3 playable characters on hero's team)
        + turn order
