DemiGod
=======

Android RPG game


 As an all-time gamer, I would like to create a retro-style, 
 turn-based RPG game. This project is being developed in java, using
 eclipse IDE, and AIDE android application. Any help, contributions,
 ideas, and/or concerns are welcome. This is a learning project for me,
 and am very excited to see where this goes.
 
 Images are currently 32x32 px, but am considering a higher resolution (64x64). 
 
 
 Unknowingly you are a DemiGod, half mortal, and half god:
 
 
 FEATURES SO FAR:
 
 * Database initialization
 
 * Character creation in the works (Name hero, choose class)
 
 IDEAS:
 
 * Xml-based index of all items
 
 * String resource vs. xml files for diologue
 
 
 
 Any questions or concerns, please email me at:
