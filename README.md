DemiGod
=======

Android RPG game


 As an all-time gamer, I would like to create a retro-style, 
 turn-based RPG game. This project is being developed in java, using
 eclipse IDE, Android Studio, and AIDE android application. Support for 
 gradle builds has been added, so now it can be built on any platform. 
 Any help, contributions, ideas, and/or concerns are welcome. 
 This is a learning project for me, and I'm very excited to see where this goes.
 
 Images are currently 32x32 px, but am considering a higher resolution (64x64).

 Unknowingly you are a DemiGod, half mortal, and half god:
 
 
 FEATURES SO FAR:
 
 * Database initialization
 
 * Character creation in the works (Name hero, choose class)
 
 IDEAS:
 
 * Xml-based index of all items
 
 * String resource vs. xml files for diologue
