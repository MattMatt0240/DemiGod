DemiGod
=======

Android RPG game


 As an all-time gamer, I would like to create a retro-style, 
 turn-based RPG game. This project is being developed in java, using
 eclipse IDE, and AIDE android application. Any help, contributions,
 ideas, and/or concerns are welcome. This is a learning project for me,
 and am very excited to see where this goes.
 
 Images are currently 32x32 px, but am considering a higher resolution (64x64). 
 

Storyline:
=========

Unknowingly, you are a demigod. Half mortal, half god. Ever since your early teenage years, you have had "incidents" 
in which you never quite understood the nature of. Sudden outrages, blackouts, and waking up feeling completely exhausted.
The more the hero aged, the more frequent the uncontrollable events would occur. Finally the hero can't help but to believe
it is some sort of witchcraft, cursed as a child. For this may not be completely false, the hero is soon to find out his
true origins...
 
 
 WORKING SO FAR:
 
 * Database initialization
 
 * Character creation in the works (Name hero, choose class)
 
 IDEAS:
 
 * Xml-based index of all items
 
 * String resource vs. xml files for diologue
